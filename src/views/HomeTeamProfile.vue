          information by the way it sounds, and you have an easier time understanding spoken instructions than written ones. You often learn by
          reading out loud because you have to hear it or speak it in order to know it.

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>These tests help me know myself better.My personality, my daily behaviors, my style of studying.The results can be the guidance of my behavior to some degree.Although there are some points in the result are against the fact, I could think about the reasons and learn more about myself and other people.

I usually tend to play a role that is not what I am good at and do something that is actually beyond my ability which harm my performance in the team. I should think about what is the best role I can play in a team combined with the test results which is helpful to be active and fit well in a team.Thus, I would change my behaviour according to the test results to see the benefits.I will continue to stay positive but try to be less idealistic to avoid subjective judgement.And it is important for me to improve social abilities.

When forming a team, I will keep the diversity and try not to bring in too much disagreements and conflicts.Thus, people with different characteristics are needed.The team members should be able to cooperate with each other well but not lacking the creativity.To make full use of members’ advantages, I will take members’ ability, personality and other features into consideration when forming the team and also respect their will.Competitions are allowed as long as it does not harm the operation of the team.While the extremists are not welcomed.
